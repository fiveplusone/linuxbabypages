# linux baby pages

linux baby pages (<code>lbp</code>) is an attempt to make concise "common uses" man pages.

It shares this goal with at least two other projects: [<code>tldr</code>](https://github.com/rprieto/tldr) and [<code>bro</code>](http://bropages.org). <code>lbp</code> is distinguished from similar projects by its rules.

# Rules

## Code

1. The <code>lbp</code> command shall be a shell script.
2. The code shall be as simple as possible.
3. The code shall have as few dependencies as possible.
4. Installation shall be as simple as possible.

## Text

1. Entries shall be no more than 2000 characters.
2. The corpus shall total no more than 100,000 characters.
3. Spaces count, but not line breaks.
4. Entries shall hard wrap at 72 characters.

# Process

<code>lbp</code> code and text is managed by two co-autocrats.
